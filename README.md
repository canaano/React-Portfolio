# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Your Task

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

Your task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

**Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to the default branch in GitHub -- NOT your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's build.
